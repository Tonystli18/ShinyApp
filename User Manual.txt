App Description

This Shiny web application provides functions for user to interact with mtcars dataset to explore 
the relationship between 3 selected dependent variables (hp. mpg & qsec) and other independent
variables.

1) There are 3 tabs for the 3 selected dependent variables:
- Panel "Gross Horsepower": dependent variable "hp", user can pick up one other variables
as independent variables except qsec.
- Panel "Miles per Gallon(US)": dependent variable "mpg", user can pick up one other variables
as independent variables except qsec.
- Panel "1/4 Mile Time": dependent variable "qsec", user can pick up one other variables
as independent variables.
        
2) On each panel, it shows the plot of selected dependent and independent variables.
- if the independent variable chosen by user is essentially a numeric variable, it will show
points plot and user can select dots to generate linear regression line.
- if the independent variable chosen by user is essentially a factor variable, it will show box plot.
